This web application is created mainly for learning and experience with web development.
And secondly for remembering for the retro 7 segment display.

*
The purpose of this app is:
  - display almost any string on the 7 segment display (maybe in a shop window, you know, OPEN CLOSE etc.)
  - it can simulate a few display test sequences (just for fun)
  - this display also can use as a digital clock (this kind of clock is retro stuff as well)
